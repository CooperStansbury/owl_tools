# Ontology Extraction
This is a command-line tool written in Python3 that can be used to execute SPARQL queries against a local OWL ontology file. This tooling is intended primarily for OBO Foundry ontologies. Results are currently printed to stdout and can be piped into a file if needed.

## Invocation
Example:
```
./owl_extract.py --owl_file <path/to/owl_file.owl> --query <path/to/query.sparql>
```

## Queries
A few common queries that I find useful. If time allows I'll add more.
